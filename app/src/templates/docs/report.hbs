1. Generate the file to be transformed somewhere (ex `.tmp/pdf-name.html`)
2. Run `phantomjs` and generate the PDF from the file above

## What's needed?
* Footer
* Header
* Find out appropriate margins (can they be different?) Yes! margin: [left: '1.2cm', right: '2.5cm', top: '1.2cm', bottom: '2.2cm']
* Does a link to an id work in PDFs? No, so no clickable index
