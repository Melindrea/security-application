# Information about the User module

Based on [this link](https://bitbucket.org/beni/laravel-4-tutorial/wiki/User_Management)

It should have the following:

* Login over SSL, with a [CSRF-token generated by Laravel](http://laravel.com/docs/html)
* Registration over SSL, with a CSRF-token generated by Laravel, as well as a Honeypot and registration-time tracking to stop automated spambots
* Logout
* Checkbox to save login, with warning about public computers. Otherwise a timeout (reasonable amount?), as well as the session being cancelled and cookies deleted once the browser is closed (how?). Just closing the tab is a bad idea, since that might risk frustration when the user has several tabs and closes one of them
* Profile with a few more fields, which can be updated, with a CSRF-token, over SSL.
* E-mail update triggers e-mail to new e-mail to confirm the change, as well as to the old e-mail as an FYI. Also requires confirming with password
* Changing password triggers e-mail, as well as requires confirming with password
* Reset password uses Laravel reminder, the form using a CSRF-token

Routes:

login/logout
