My name is Marie Hogebrandt, and I live in Katrineholm, about an hour and a half from Stockholm. Currently I work as a developer at Pineberry, which is an SEO- and Web Bureau. I finished my Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering at Mid-Sweden University, Sundsvall, in June of 2011, where my focus was programming and within that a personal focus on the Internet, as I am fascinated by the limitations of web programming and how to overcome these.

To me, it is an interesting challenge to see how I can better myself. I keep myself up to date with what is going on in the World Wide Web through Twitter and blogs, and love to test new things. I just love to program, no matter how trite that sounds.

At my current work we use Git for version control, and I have personally picked up the habit of developing front end with the help of Yeoman and Grunt, so that my JavaScript gets automatically linted and beautified, and Modernizr is only as large as is required for the tests I actually use. We also do most of the external projects using WordPress as a CMS, and the internal tools use Kohana as a framework.

Apart from computers and development I have many hobbies that I pick up from time to time. I love to sew, sometimes I draw or paint, sometimes I write. Most often my creativity goes towards role playing, which is a large part of my life. I generally play online as I don't have any people around me to play with. I love to sing, and to dance.
