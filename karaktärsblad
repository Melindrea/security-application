Soak:

    You can choose how you want to notate the soak, but remember that bashing soak is your stamina+bashing soak from armour, lethal is either 0 (non-enlightened mortals) or half of your stamina (rounded down) + lethal soak from armour. Aggravated is equal to the lethal soak of your armour.

DDV: Dexterity+Dodge, add essence if your essence is higher than 1. Divide by two. Round down if non-enlightened mortal, up if other.
PDV: Dexterity + melee or martial art, add the defense of your weapon. Divide by two. Rounding is, as above, depending on if you're a non-enlightened mortal or not.

MDVs

DMDV: Willpower+Integrity, add essence if your essence is higher than 1. Divide by two. Always rounds down.
PMDVs (honest/dishonest)
